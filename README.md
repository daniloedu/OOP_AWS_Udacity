# OOP_AWS_Udacity
Exercise to practice Object Oriented Programing in Python to create a Salesperson and Pants Classes.

# Instructions
**Exercise: Use the Pants class**
Now that you've had some practice instantiating objects, it's time to write your own class from scratch.

This lesson has two parts.


**Write a Pants class with the following characteristics:
* the class name should be Pants
* the class attributes should include
 * color
 * waist_size
 * length
 * price
* the class should have an init function that initializes all of the attributes
* the class should have two methods
 * change_price() a method to change the price attribute
 * discount() to calculate a discount


**Write a SalesPerson class with the following characteristics:
* the class name should be SalesPerson
* the class attributes should include
 * first_name 
 * last_name
 * employee_id
 * salary
 * pants_sold
 * total_sales
* the class should have an init function that initializes all of the attributes
* the class should have four methods
 * sell_pants() a method to change the price attribute
 * calculate_sales() a method to calculate the sales
 * display_sales() a method to print out all the pants sold with nice formatting
 * calculate_commission() a method to calculate the salesperson commission based on total sales and a percentage
