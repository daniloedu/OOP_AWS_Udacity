This lesson has two parts. In the first part, you'll write a Pants class. This class is similar to the shirt class with a couple of changes. Then you'll practice instantiating Pants objects\n\nIn the second part, you'll write another class called SalesPerson. You'll also instantiate objects for the SalesPerson.\n\nFor this exercise, you can do all of your work in this Jupyter notebook. You will not need to import the class because all of your code will be in this Jupyter notebook.\n\nAnswers are also provided.
